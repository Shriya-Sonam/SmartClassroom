# SmartClassroom
E-learning website using MERN stack


Users can register as Teacher or student. If user is registered as teacher he/she can create a course and upload lectures and supplementary materials. Teachers can send invitations to students to join their couse. Teachers can also create profile where they can showcase their skills, education and their social media profile. Students can view courses of only those teachers from whom they have received invitations. They can like and post comment on respective course.


This project is created using Node.js and express.js for backend. MongoDB is used as the database. Authentication and authorization is handled using JWT. Bcrypt is used to hash password and files are uploaded using multer. For frontend I have react.js and Bootstrap for UI design.
